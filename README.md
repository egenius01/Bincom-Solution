### Project 1

- Parcel Delivery System (REST-API)

- This is a Django Rest application for a parcel delivery system covering at least 5 use cases, 3 entities and two user types.

- I used Django and Django Rest Framework which allowed me to efficiently build a robust and scalable backend system for the parcel delivery application, with clear separation of concerns and a maintainable codebase.

- I used Django and Django Rest Framework to build a RESTful API for the parcel delivery system.

- [Link to the screenshot of the project](https://github.com/egenius01/Parcel-Delivery-System-REST-API-)

- As a developer, my role in the project was to design and implement the RESTful API endpoints using Django and Django Rest Framework. I was responsible for ensuring that the API met the functional requirements specified in the project scope, as well as implementing proper error handling and validation.  Additionally, I was responsible for providing unit tests for the API endpoints and providing thorough code comments to facilitate future maintenance and updates.

- As the lead developer on the project, my key activities involved:

  1. Developing the application architecture and database schema.
  2. Implementing the REST-API endpoints for the various use cases.
  3. Writing the models, views, and serializers for the Parcel, Delivery Driver, and Customer entities.
  4. Implementing authentication and authorization using Django's built-in authentication system.
  5. Testing and debugging the application to ensure it meets the project requirements.

### Project 2

- GitSync Hub

- This Django app allows you to clone a GitHub repository and save its JSON data to an SQL database Asynchronously using celery, its covering at least 5 use cases, 2 Entities and 2 User Types.

- The strategy used in implementing the GitSync Hub project was to create a Django application that utilizes the Celery library to asynchronously clone a GitHub repository and save its JSON data to an SQL database. This approach ensures that the user experience is not affected by the potentially time-consuming process of cloning the repository and storing its data, as it is done in the background by the Celery task queue. Also, the use of Django and Celery ensures that the application is scalable, efficient, and maintainable.

- The tools used for this project are:
  1. Django
  2. Django Rest Framework
  3. Celery
  4. Redis
  5. MySql
  6. GitPython
  7. Tailwind css
  8. Jquery

- [Link to the screenshot of the project](https://github.com/egenius01/GitSyncHub#readme)

- I was the lead developer on this project.

- As the sole developer on this project, my key activities included the following:

Research and Planning: I conducted research on the GitHub API and designed the database schema that would be used to store the JSON data. I also planned out the project architecture, including the use of Celery for asynchronous task processing.

Development: I developed the Django app using the Django REST framework, integrating Celery for the asynchronous task processing. I also created the logic to perform the cloning and syncing of GitHub repositories, as well as unit tests to ensure the reliability of the system.

Overall, the project involved complex asynchronous processing using Celery, integration with the GitHub API, and ensuring reliability and scalability of the system. My tasks included designing the architecture, implementing the system and testing.

Briefly Describe How your Profile and Experience Matches this Requirement.

#### What software tools/technology tools have you used to fulfil your role?

In my previous role, I worked as a software developer for Taskpie . One of the tasks I was involved in was to Plan and modify the database schema.

My role was to develop and modify the database schema design, develop test cases for the functionalities added, ensure proper documentation of code, and introduce new functionalities to the platform.

To achieve these tasks, I started by analyzing the existing database schema design and identified areas of redundancy. I then modified the design to eliminate the redundancy, leading to a 55% increase in performance. Additionally, I worked closely with the team to identify areas that required new functionalities and generated ideas to implement them, which led to a 30% increase in new features.

To ensure proper functionality of the platform, I developed test cases for the functionalities added by me or other team members, which improved the functionality by 30%. I also made sure that there was proper documentation for all the code that I wrote or came across in the project, which improved the organization's code readability by 40%.

As a result of my efforts, the platform became more efficient, reliable, and user-friendly, resulting in increased user satisfaction. The new functionalities I introduced helped to expand the application's capabilities, while the improved code readability and the availability of test cases ensured that the application was easy to maintain and debug. Overall, my contributions to the project helped the team to achieve its goals effectively and efficiently.

#### Have you led a tech team before? How do you keep track of everyone’s work?
To keep track of everyone's work, I would start by establishing clear project goals and objectives and breaking them down into smaller tasks. I would assign tasks to team members based on their strengths and areas of expertise, and set realistic deadlines for completion.

I would also hold regular meetings with the team to review progress, discuss any challenges or roadblocks, and make any necessary adjustments to the project plan. During these meetings, I would encourage team members to share updates on their work and raise any concerns or questions they may have.

Additionally, I would use project management tools such as Trello or github to track the progress of individual tasks and the project as a whole. These tools would allow me to see at a glance who is working on what and how far along they are in the process.

Overall, my approach to keeping track of everyone's work would be to establish clear goals, communicate effectively with the team, and use the right tools to stay organized and on track.
